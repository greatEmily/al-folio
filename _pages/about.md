Hi, I’m **Emily Duran** —an aspiring web developer, content creator, and endurance athlete based in Texas. I thrive on building structured workflows that balance creative output with long-distance running and technical problem-solving.

Whether I’m trying to learn to code my dream app or learning how to fuel and train for my next race, I approach every challenge with adaptability, clarity, and a growth mindset. My current goals include running a full marathon in March 2026, completing a half marathon milestone this December, and evolving my GitHub Pages site into a polished, accessible hub for my work and ideas.

I’m passionate about:
- **Running & Triathlon training**, learning new things with each mile that passes
- **Web development**, with a focus on clean, maintainable design
- **Content creation**, integrating filming into daily routines

I believe in iterative progress, honest problem-solving, and routines that support both physical and creative endurance. Thanks for visiting - I’m always building something new.
